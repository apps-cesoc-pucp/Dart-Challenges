# CHALLENGE 2: STAIRCASE

## Problem
Consider a staircase of size **`n=4`**:
```
   #
  ##
 ###
####
```
Observe that its base and height are both equal to **_n_**, and the image is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.

Write a program that prints staircases of size **_n_**, where **_n_** is each number of the list given as `inputs`.

**_n_** is an integer.

## Input Format
A list with n numbers

## Output Format
Print staircases for each value using # symbols and spaces.

## Constraints
```
1 <= n <=100
n is each number in list
```

## Example 
### Input
```
[3, 5, 7]
```

### Output
