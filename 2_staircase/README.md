## Problem
Consider a staircase of size **`n=4`**:
```
   #
  ##
 ###
####
```
Observe that its base and height are both equal to **_n_**, and the image is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.

Write a program that reads the csv input and prints staircases of size **_n_**, where **_n_** is each number of the csv file.

**_n_** is an integer.

## Input Format
